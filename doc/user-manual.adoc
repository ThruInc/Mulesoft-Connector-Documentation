[[overview]]
== Overview

Thru MFT Connector for MuleSoft Anypoint Studio is an out-of-the-box connector to implement file exchange with external and internal organizations for your Mule Flows. The connector enables Thru MFT as a service (MFTaaS) cloud platform to a solution based on Mule ESB. Thru MFT cloud service implements the following features for the MuleSoft-based enterprise solutions:

- Reliable file exchange between organizations and Mule Flows with audit, alerts and business continuity
- Partner Management with subscriptions, self-management, reusable endpoints, support, and out of the box protocols and API connectors
- Centralized system of record  
- Monitoring and control of all file transfers across all organizations using real-time end-to-end processing dashboards
- Scalable and secure REST API for Mule and other connectors
- Developer environment

Thru MFT Connector for MuleSoft Anypoint Studio and Thru MFT cloud service allow MuleSoft developers to focus on business logic, while Thru service and connector handle file exchange with organizations. Key benefits for developers include:

- Separation of data processing in Mule Flows from file exchange with organizations via Thru MFT
- Unified connector API for pickup, drop-off and exception handling, independent of partner endpoint type and method/protocol. Endpoints are managed in Thru MFT service and are invisible to Mule Flows.
- Subscription model instead of addressing.

Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic file transfer using Thru MFT connector. Track feature additions, compatibility, limitations, and API version updates with each release of the connector using the link:release-notes.adoc[Connector Release Notes].
Review the <<operations,Connector Operations>> section and notes on demo Flows in the link:https://github.com/ThruInc/muleconnector2.0/blob/release/2.0.0/demo/mft-demo-1.0/README.md[Demo Applications description].

[[important-concepts]]
== Important Concepts

Main Concepts in Thru MFT cloud service which is enabled by Thru MFT connector:

*Transport* :  An abstract entity in Thru MFT service which controls exchange of the files between Mule Flow and Organizations (Partners) according to business processes. One Mule Flow connects to one Thru MFT Transport using Thru MFT connector for Mulesoft in One-to-One mapping. Organizations subscribe to Transports to exchange files with specific Mule Flows. Transports can be of different types: Feed, Private Exchange, Broadcast Push, and other. In each Mule Flow Thru MFT connector is configured to communicate with with a single Transport, see <<configure, How To Configure>>. Transports are managed in Thru MFT portal:

*Organization* : External Partner or internal enterprise organizational unit which exchanges files with Mule ESB Flows as part of the enterprise solution. Organizations can be subscribed to one or multiple Transports to exchange files with different Mule Flows as part of different integration workflows. Organizations and Transports support many to many mapping. Organization subscriptions to Transports are managed by enterprise administrators or self-managed by Organization administrators via Thru MFT portal:

image:Organization.png[Organizations]


*Endpoint* : One or more endpoints can be created in each Organization such as FTPS and SFTP servers and clients, AWS S3 storage, IMAP mailboxes and other. Endpoints can be managed by enterprise administrators or self-managed by Organization administrators. Endpoints exchange files between external repositories of the organization and Thru MFT service, can participate in multiple Transports connecting to Mule Flows and are therefore re-usable.

image:Endpoints.png[Endpoints]


*Persistence* : Thru MFT service has build-in file repository which scales horizontally, stores the files that are transferred between Mule Flow and Organization endpoints and supports flexible retention policies.


*Simple API* Thru MFT service implements simple and comprehensive REST API which is exposed via Thru MFT connector API, see <<operations,Connector Operations>>

== How to Install

You can install the connector in Anypoint Studio using the instructions in
link:https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-studio/v/7.1/add-modules-in-studio-to[Add Modules to Your Studio Project].

[[upgrading]]
=== Upgrading from an Older Version

If you’re currently using an older version of the connector, a small popup appears in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Studio with an "Updates Available" message.

. Click the popup and check for available updates. 
. Click the Connector version checkbox, click *Next*, and follow the instructions provided by the user interface. 
. *Restart* Studio when prompted. 
. After restarting, when creating a Flow and using the connector, if you have several versions of the connector installed, you may be asked which version you would like to use. Choose the version you would like to use.

Additionally, we recommend that you keep Studio up to date with its latest version.

Thru MFT connector provides the following global Element properties for each Flow:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Field |Description
|*Name* | Enter a descriptive name for Thru MFT Transport to which Thru MFT connector will communicate. Recommended practice is to append public transport code to the end for troubleshooting purposes, for example *ThruTransport__TRN041416*
|*API Url* | Url defines Thru MFT instance running the Transport to which Thru connector communicates. Provided to administrator when web API access is configured for a Transport in Thru MFT portal, see screenshot below.
|*Site Url* |Url defines a file repository used by Thru MFT. Provided to administrator when web API access is configured for a Transport in Thru MFT portal, see screenshot below.
|*Site Key* |API Key for the connector to access Thru MFT instance. Provided to administrator when web API access is configured for a Transport in Thru MFT portal, see screenshot below.
|*Flow Secret* | A secret key for Thru MFT connector in given Flow to access selected Transport. Provided to administrator when web API access is configured for a Transport in Thru MFT portal, see screenshot below.

[[operations]]
== Connector Operations

Thru MFT connector is an operation-based connector, meaning you need to configure a specific operation for the connector to perform if you add the connector to a Flow in a Mule application.

The connector supports the following list of operations:

image:ThruConnectorOperations.png[List of Thru MFT connector operations]

*File Pickup* :  Download (pickup) file from a linked Thru MFT Transport and pass to Mule Flow. Polling is used and polling frequency can be set. Streaming method is used, no limits on file size.

image:FilePickup.png[File Pickup]

*Set Variable* : Need description and explanation of Set Variable.

image:SetVariable.png[Set Variable]

*Flow Outcome* Passes resulting status of the Flow to Thru MFT service, where it can be viewed in dashboards by the administrators. Mule Flow result :  1-passed, 2-failed, 3-mixed. Mixed cases may happen in the batch processing when some records generate exceptions. In case of batch processing Flow Outcome may optionally return notes on the Flow outcome, ID of Mule message, counters of total and Failed records.

Simple Flow Outcome:

*FileDropoff*  Upload (Drop-off) a file from Mule Flow to a linked Transport in Thru MFT. File is uploaded by chunks and size is not limited. File payload, Name and Size should be provided in the message. If outgoing file is a result of processing of incoming file (e.g. exceptions in the data), file code of original file should be provided.

*File Metadata* Thru File Metadata database is available for review in dashboards by administrators. Size of the returned exception metadata is limited to 10MB per call.
